## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a> <br>
  
I know it's a little nerve racking to make your first contribution to Open Source. You'll be fine!

## Using Github <a name="github"></a> <br>

DO NOT TRY TO PUSH DIRECTLY TO MAIN! 

If it's your first time using git or any kind of version control, I suggest using Github Desktop or [Gitkraken](https://support.gitkraken.com/how-to-install/). Gitkraken is my favorite and I think the easiest to use. You will want to [clone](https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-repositories/open-clone-init/) this repository onto your own computer, and then make your own [branch](https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-repositories/branching-and-merging/). Name your branch whatever you want (usually a feature name or your name). 
  
Once you have made all your changes, make sure everything is [pushed](https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-repositories/pushing-and-pulling/) to your branch. Then make a [Pull Request](https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-repositories/pull-requests/) from your branch into dev. Not main! Dev is where everything will live until it's all working together.

## Using Unity <a name="unity"></a> <br>
 
This project uses Unity version 2020.2.3f1, and you should do the same. The [Unity Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.3/Documentation/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingHub.html) is good to have if you don't. 
  
To make things easier for me to maintain, and for everyone to get their PRs approved, please make a scene for yourself. Do all of your work and changes in it. Make [prefabs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CreatingPrefabs.html) of the objects you make so others can use it, and use other prefabs in your scene. 
  
To learn more Unity skills, check out [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/), [Code Monkey](https://unitycodemonkey.com/), and [Bracky's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA) for a good spot to start. Googling things is a good skill for every dev to learn.

 ## Coding Conventions <a name="cc"></a> <br>
 It's good to get into the habit of following any Technical Design Document. Please follow the [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions) as best as you can. Also, try not to make everything public, it's a really bad habit to have. Use [Serialize Field] to expose variables to the editor.
